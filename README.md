# revert-martingale-money-management

The Revert Martingale strategy is designed to take advantage of consecutive wins. 
In this system, after every win, the bet is increased but instead of doubling it, the bet size is adjusted as a percentage of the current balance. 
The goal is to accumulate small wins over time while avoiding large losses.
